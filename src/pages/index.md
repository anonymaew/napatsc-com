Hello! I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science.

I am interested in front-end and physics simulation,  
currently learning about back-end and artificial intelligence.  
I love tinkering stuff and creating small projects solving everyday problems;  
looking forward to contributing to communities!  
I also enjoy rock climbing and hiking in nature.
